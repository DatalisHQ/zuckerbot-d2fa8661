# zuckerbot-mcp

**CLI + MCP server for ZuckerBot — run Facebook ad campaigns from your terminal or AI agent.**

Install one package and get both:

- `zuckerbot` for humans running campaigns from the terminal
- `zuckerbot-mcp` for MCP-compatible AI agents
- `zuckerbot serve` as an alternative way to start MCP server mode

The CLI and MCP server both use the same ZuckerBot API client, authentication, and endpoints.

## Quick Start

### Human CLI

```bash
npm install -g zuckerbot-mcp
export ZUCKERBOT_API_KEY=zb_live_your_key_here

zuckerbot preview https://example.com
zuckerbot create https://example.com --budget 2000 --objective leads
zuckerbot meta status
```

### Global install

```bash
npm install -g zuckerbot-mcp
```

After global install, these commands are available:

- `zuckerbot`
- `zuckerbot-mcp`
- `zuckerbot serve`

### MCP Server: Claude Desktop

## Example Conversation

> **User:** Can you set up Facebook ads for my yoga studio? Website is serenity-yoga.com
>
> **Agent:** Let me research your business first…
> *(calls `zuckerbot_research_reviews` + `zuckerbot_research_competitors` in parallel)*
>
> Your studio has a 4.9-star rating with 89 reviews! Customers love the "calming atmosphere" and "expert instructors." Your competitors are running generic discount ads — none mention reviews or instructor credentials. That's your edge.
>
> Let me generate a preview of what your ads would look like…
> *(calls `zuckerbot_preview_campaign`)*
>
> Here are two ad concepts:
> 1. **"4.9 Stars, 89 Reviews"** — Leads with social proof. Your competitors aren't doing this.
> 2. **"First Class Free"** — Low-commitment offer to get people in the door.
>
> Want me to create a full campaign with targeting and budget recommendations?
>
> **User:** Yes. Budget is $15/day. Use the smarter flow if you can.
>
> *(calls `zuckerbot_create_campaign` with `mode: "auto"` and gets an intelligence draft)*
>
> **Agent:** The account has enough business context, so I created an intelligence draft. Best plan is:
> 1. Approve the broad local tier and the customer lookalike tier
> 2. Send two angles to creative production
> 3. Activate only the tiers that have finished assets
>
> *(calls `zuckerbot_approve_campaign_strategy`, then `zuckerbot_request_creative`)*
>
> **User:** Upload these finished assets and launch the ready tier.
>
> *(calls `zuckerbot_upload_creative`, then `zuckerbot_activate_campaign`)*
>
> **Agent:** The approved tier is live. I can monitor performance and sync lead quality back into Meta as conversions arrive.

## Typical Agent Flow

1. **Research** → `research_reviews` + `research_competitors` (parallel)
2. **Preview** → `preview_campaign` (show the user what ads look like)
3. **Create** → `create_campaign` (returns intelligence draft when a business can be resolved)
4. **Approve** → `approve_campaign_strategy`
5. **Creative** → `request_creative` or `upload_creative`
6. **Activate** → `activate_campaign`
7. **Monitor** → `get_performance`
8. **Optimize** → `sync_conversion` and audience tools as downstream signal volume grows
